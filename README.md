# rbx-lua
Scripts or utilities created in Roblox-Lua. Most here are free to use.

### Usage
Most scripts will display which area they should be placed in, unless automatically placed by another script.
For instance, some scripts may be entirely _clientside_ or entirely _serverside_.

I'll expect all users to know how to use the scripts properly if they are using _FilteringEnabled_ or having _Experimental Mode_ disabled.
